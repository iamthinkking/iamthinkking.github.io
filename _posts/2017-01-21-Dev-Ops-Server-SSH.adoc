## The Problem

Generally, it is good to practise systems administration skills especially when persuing a career in linux. Today I set out to install a two virtual machines(VM) (ubuntu server 16.10 and fedora server 25), then install on open ERP on them both. The ERP chosen is https://www.odoo.com/[Odoo]. I am using GNOME Boxes as it is simple enough to spin up a VM quickly. Also, GNOME Boxes uses KVM, as the hypervisor, and QMENU, as the machine emulator. 
Unfortunately copying and pasting strings into GNOME Boxes's emulator just wasn't happening. So, I opted to ssh into the servers instead.

## The Solution

To SSH into a server, you want to be able to do it as securely as possible, why else would you be using a Secure Socket Shell to interface anything? So both ends of the communication channel need to have a key to state that, indeed, they are who they claim to be. It's like entering a secret club but having to say a special phrase first. Both you and the individual behind the door need to know the passphrase. So here's how to do that:

 1. Generate an RSA key pair by typing the following at a shell prompt:
 
    
    ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter file in which to save the key (/home/john/.ssh/id_rsa): 
    

 2. Press Enter to confirm the default location (that is, ~/.ssh/id_rsa) for the newly created key.
Enter a passphrase, and confirm it by entering it again when prompted to do so. For security reasons, avoid using the same password as you use to log in to your account.
After this, you will be presented with a message similar to this:
    
    Your identification has been saved in /home/john/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Your public key has been saved in /home/john/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    e7:97:c7:e2:0e:f9:0e:fc:c4:d7:cb:e5:31:11:92:14 john@penguin.example.com
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ RSA 2048]----+
    |             E.  |
    |            . .  |
    |             o . |
    |              . .|
    |        S .    . |
    |         + o o ..|
    |          * * +oo|
    |           O +..=|
    |           o*  o.|
    +-----------------+
    
3. Change the permissions of the ~/.ssh/ directory:
    ```
    ~]$ chmod 755 ~/.ssh
    ```
4. Copy the content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the machine to which you want to connect, appending it to its end if the file already exists.
5. Change the permissions of the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file using the following command:
    ```
    ~]$ chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

Now that we have generated and shared our SSH key, we will need to install `openssh-server` on our local machine so port 22 will be opened for us to us as our tunnel of communication. 

**NB: This `dnf` is for fedora, use `apt-get` if you're on ubuntu:**

 1. Installing openSSH Server:
    
    dnf install openssh-server
    
    
 2. Check to ensure port 22 is opened
    
    netstat -ant | grep 22

 3. Time to SSH into our server:
 
     ssh -p 22 [username]@[ip_address]
 
Now we have successfully SSH'd into our server @smileðŸ˜ƒ

* This has been tested on fedora 25, using GNOME Boxes, and terminix. There shouldn't be any great differences on other platforms/environments.
